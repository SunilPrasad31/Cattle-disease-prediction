# Cattle Disease Prediction
# Overview
Cattle Disease Prediction is a project that utilizes machine learning techniques to predict diseases in cattle based on their symptoms. By analyzing symptoms provided by users, the system offers predictions for various diseases commonly found in cattle. This project aims to assist veterinarians and farmers in diagnosing illnesses in cattle, thereby enabling timely intervention and treatment.

# Features
Graphical User Interface (GUI): The project provides a user-friendly GUI for inputting cattle symptoms and obtaining disease predictions.
Machine Learning Models: Implemented machine learning models include Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors, offering diverse approaches for disease prediction.
Interactive Symptom Selection: Users can select symptoms from a checklist, allowing for easy and intuitive input.
Predicted Disease Display: The predicted disease is displayed to the user, aiding in quick diagnosis and decision-making.
Usage
# Installation:

Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Install required libraries by running:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Dataset:

Download the dataset training.csv to train the machine learning models.
Run Application:

Execute the cattle_disease_prediction.py script to launch the GUI application.
Enter the name of the cattle and select symptoms from the checklist.
Click on the prediction buttons to obtain disease predictions.
The predicted disease will be displayed to the user.
